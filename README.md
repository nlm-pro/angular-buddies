## Motivation

We want to offer as much help as possible in order to ease JS / Angular development, enhance Developer Experience and permit you to easily write quality code even if you are a beginner or on your own.

To do so, we:

* mainly rely on the excellent [Angular Devkit][angular-devkit], which allows our "buddies" to integrate well into your existing Angular project with Angular CLI, but also to be usable in other contexts (even those without Angular).
* have established [guidelines][guidelines] for our packages that we strive to always meet.

## Want to help?

Want to file a bug, contribute some code, or improve documentation? Excellent! Read up on our
guidelines for [contributing][contributing] and then check out one of our issues in the [hotlist: community-help](https://github.com/angular-buddies/angular-buddies/labels/hotlist%3A%20community-help).

## Foreign buddies

We would like to thanks all this projects' contributors for their amazing work. They all are true Open Source buddies, and whithout them, this project would not exist:

* [Angular CLI / Devkit][angular-devkit], development tools and libraries specialized for Angular.
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), opinionated code formatter.
