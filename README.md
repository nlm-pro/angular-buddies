## Your buddies

:cat: Petter (short for [@angular-buddies/prettier](./packages/prettier/README.md)) knows how to make your code pretty using Prettier.

## Principles

Good buddies have principles, and these Angular Buddies are no exception. To do so, they all are:

### Considerate

`Good buddies think about your own good before their own.`

Sometimes, JS dev is hard. Sometimes, you don't know if what you do is right and hope for advise. Angular Buddies are here to help you with that. By trying to distill some of the hive mind of the Angular Community into tooling, we hope we could help writing good JS code with ease, even for beginners.

> Our first goal is to enhance your developer experience. We place ease of use above anything else, and try to propose you the best solutions in order to facilitate javascript development.

### Open Minded

`Good buddies do not impose their predilections, and respect your preferences.`

> Even if this tools are mainly create by and for the Angular Community, a good part knows how to help you with any other JS dev solution, such as React, Vue.js, Node, etc...

### Independent

`Good buddies do not impose their own buddies.`

When you invite a buddy home, you don't need to have other people you don't know staying on your coach all night.

Angular Buddies think the same! They all can help you on their own.

> You can use every package alone. This packages will never impose you to use another of ours if you don't want to.

### Team Players

`Good buddies know how to get along with your other buddies.`

You don't want to lost other buddies when you find new ones. Even better, you hope that they get along nicely.

Angular Buddies agree! They all play nice with one another and your old buddies.

> This packages propose progressive enhancement in order to enhance your experience if you use them with other ones.

## Foreign buddies

We would like to thanks all this projects' contributors for their amazing work. They all are true Open Source buddies, and whithout them, this project would not exist:

* [Angular CLI / Devkit](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), development tools and libraries specialized for Angular.
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), opinionated code formatter.
