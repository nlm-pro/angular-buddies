## Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```

## Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.

## Lint

`npm run prettify` will format all the code base thanks to prettier.
